What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Many of them are derived from the unix philosophies:

have each program do one thing well
write programs so they can work with other programs (their outputs can be easily used as inputs to other programs)
write programs to work with text streams, since everything can work with that

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a simulation of a computer located on another, larger computer. The advantages are that such simulations are easy to create and nearly completely isolated from the main system - if you break it, just make another one/

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

There are protections put in place to keep people from running scripts that will break their computer without realizing it - denying user accounts write access to certain files, for example. If you're root you can do anything so a bad keystroke can destroy your computer without warning
