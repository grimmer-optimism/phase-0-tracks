// Create a function named 'reverse' that takes a string and
// splits the string into individual components creating an array and gaining access to array functions.
// Found reverse function for arrays on MDN, but this doesn't bring the components back together
// Concatate the array into a string for the final finalanswer
// No implicit return so need to return answer
